                    <p>
                        When designing graphics, there are a few key principles to keep in mind.<br>
                        The very first is to lay out your graphics in a way that is "comfortable" to look at.<br>
                        Most things should have a margin (an empty space around the edge) to prevent them from feeling cramped.<br>
                        Unlike in the CSS Box Model, there isn't a rigid requirement for needing a padding and border; the important thing is that elements of your design have breathing room.

                    <h1>Readability</h1>
                    <p>
                        Readability is one of the goals of graphic design, especially if you have text in your design.<br>
                        There are a few general rules to follow:<br>
                        1) Use a readable font<br>
                        2) Use a font size that is large enough to read comfortably<br>
                        3) Use a color that contrasts with the background<br>
                        On top of that, if you have lots of text, you can break it up into smaller paragraphs and add headings to make it easier to read.

                <section id="cc" class="page-section">
                    <h1>Color choices</h1>
                    <p>
                        Your choice of colors can have a big impact on the overall look and feel of your design.<br>
                        This article will not go into detail about color theory, but there are a few things to keep in mind:<br>
                        1) <b>Avoid using too many colors</b>—Stick to a limited color palette to create a cohesive look. Too many colors at once can clash and make your design look chaotic.<br>
                        2) <b>Use colors that complement each other</b>—You can use a color wheel to find colors that work well together. Complementary colors create strong contrast, while analogous or monochromatic colors create a more harmonious and cohesive look.<br>
                        3) <b>Use colors that fit the mood of your design</b>—Different colors can evoke different emotions. For example, blue is often associated with calmness.<br>
                        Additionally, you may want to consider accessibility when choosing colors, ensuring that your design is readable for those with color vision deficiencies.

                    <h1>Decorative flair</h1>
                    <p>
                            Decorative flair can add a unique touch to your design, but it takes time to add tastefully. 
                            There are many types of decorative flair, like floating images, background patterns, and emissive effects.<br>
                            However, it's important to use them sparingly and ensure they enhance rather than distract from your main content. 
                            The key aspect of decorative flair is recognising that graphic design isn't just about text, but also the subtle and proper use of images to create an experience.
